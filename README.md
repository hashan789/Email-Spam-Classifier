# Email-Spam-Classifier

An email spam classifier is a machine learning model that is trained to classify emails as spam or not spam. Spam emails are unsolicited and unwanted emails that are often sent in bulk for commercial purposes. They can also be dangerous, as they may contain malicious links or attachments that can infect your computer with malware.

Email spam classifiers work by extracting features from emails and then using those features to train a model. The features that are extracted can vary, but they often include things like the email's subject line, body text, sender address, and recipient address. The model is then trained on a dataset of emails that have already been labeled as spam or not spam. Once the model is trained, it can be used to classify new emails.

In this case, I have used the logistic regression algorithm to build an email spam classifier.

Email spam classifiers are an important tool for protecting users from spam. They can help to reduce the amount of spam that users receive, and they can also help to protect users from malicious emails.

Here are some of the benefits of using an email spam classifier:

* It can help to reduce the amount of spam that you receive.
* It can help to protect you from malicious emails.
* It can save you time by automatically filtering out spam emails.
* It can improve your email inbox experience by making it easier to find the emails that you want.

If you are looking for a way to reduce the amount of spam that you receive, then an email spam classifier is a good option. There are many different spam classifiers available, so you can choose one that is right for you.
